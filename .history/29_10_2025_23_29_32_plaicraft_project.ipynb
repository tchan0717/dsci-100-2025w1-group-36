So, it may not be the exact amount of players, but it should be relatively close. We can see that from 2 - 5am, there are the most number of players online on PlaiCraft. The number of players online is the lowest between 8am-2pm, and increases again from 3pm to the end of the day. I can connect these observations to the visualization above in that I can assume that young adults are most likely in class or working.

My question is more dependent on time of sessions and how many players are playing. Thus, the players.csv dataset does not contain any variables that will effectively aid my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model chosen is appropriate because one, I am looking to predict a numerical value, which compared to classification, would not be able to do. Two, with basing my classifer off of the explanatory variable of \"time of day\" and response variable of \"number of players online\", I would be able to efficiently input any hour of the day and collect the average output that the classifier computed based on the closest *k* I choose and previous data of how many players are expected to be online. I can then decide myself if the number of players online is exceeding the number of licenses I currently have at hand for that time of day and decide what the best course of action is for the licenses.\n",

    "Fortunately, the non-linear regression model does not require much assumptions compared to the linear one where it assumes that the data is linear. A reason for its minimal assumptions is due to its nearest neighbours system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of the method selected are that. Fortunately, this dataset is not too large so far, so it will not take long to compute an average outcome. However, it can become a problem for when I want to add a lot more data in to get a more accurate outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the data, I will first split the dataset into a training and testing set using the function *initial_split* and then *training* and *testing*. The proportions would be 75% training and 25% testing.\n",
    "Next, I will use cross-validation on the training set to choose an appropriate *k* value. I will use the *nearest_neighbor* function with the arguments of \"rectangular\" weight_func and \"tune()\" for neighbors. The engine and mode will be \"kknn\" and \"regression\" respectively. Furthermore, I will create a recipe using the *recipe* function. My response variable will be the count of players online and the explanatory variable will be the time of day. The data argument will be the training set. I will scale and center all predictors so that the variables are on a comparable scale and none will overtake another. This is especially important for a KNN classifer system.\n",
    "The cross-validation comes next. It is recommended to use 5 - 10 folds, so I will go with 5. I will use the *vfold_cv* function with the arguments of 5 folds and the count of players online being the strata. Likewise, I will create a workflow with the recipe and model I created.\n",
    "I will then make check the a tibble that will contain the range of *k* values from 1 to () by (). Additionally, I will use *tune_grid* with the arguments of my cross validation set as the resamples and grid as my tibble. Then, I will use *collect_metrics*, filter for \"rmse\" and use *slice_min* for the mean to get the most optimal *k*.\n",
    "Testing comes next. I will repeat the steps to make the model, but change \"tune()\" for the optimal *k*. I will create a workflow with the same recipe, new model, and fit the data into the training set. Then, I can use *predict* on the testing data that was split beforehand. Use *bind_cols* to attach that prediction column to the testing data and then see the metrics with the arguments of truth being total count of players online and estimate being \".pred\".\n",
