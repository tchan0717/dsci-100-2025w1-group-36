    "The model objective is to predict *played_hours* from *Age* and *experience* to help decide which players to \"target\". I'd use KNN regression with players.csv as it contains all necessary variables and mutate the *experience* categories to numerical levels (1=beginner,...5=pro). \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression is appropriate because it's flexible, doesn't assume relationship shapes, and predicts numerical values off similarities with training data. Contrastingly, KNN classification predicts categories. Visualizations, like #1, show no linear relationship, so linear regression isn't preferred. To confirm the better model, KNN vs linear, I'd assess them on the testing data. The smaller RMSPE value is the better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose predictor variables, experience and Age, because they describe player \"kinds\" and provide meaningful differences in the data to predict played_hours from. Typically, they contribute significantly to determining total gametime. For example, pros and younger players may play longer hours. Gender was excluded due to ambiguous values, \"prefer not to say\" and \"other\", which don't aid in distinguishing player \"kinds\". Furthermore, session times are random; it's not a unique player behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### I'll process the data using the general KNN regression model steps with noted adjustments:\n",
    "1. Mutate \"experience\"\n",
    "2. Inspect and clean data\n",
    "3. Split dataset\n",
    "    - 75% training, 25% testing\n",
    "4. Tune training set\n",
    "    - Scale predictors\n",
    "5. Cross-validate training set\n",
    "    - 5 folds\n",
    "    - Tested neighbors differ by 4; neighbors = 1,5,...196\n",
    "6. Find optimal *k*, refit model, assess on testing data for RMSPE\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression requires few assumptions, but has drawbacks. It assumes new observations resemble its training data. Thus, it's prone to inaccurate predictions for observations outside the training data range. Larger datasets increase computation time, and it's sensitive to noisy data and distance-dependent. So, scaling is needed to ensure comparable variable scales."
