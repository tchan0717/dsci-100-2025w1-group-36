    "Choosing an appropriate prediction model is important for accurate and strong performances. I would approach my question using KNN regression. I would work with the players.csv dataset as it contains played_hours, Age, and experience; all variables I need. The model objective is to input any age and experience and receive a prediction for the total hours they may contribute. Then, we can decide whether to \"target\" those players.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression is appropriate because it's flexible and I want to predict numerical values, played_hours. Contrastly, KNN classification is for categorical predictions. Judging by visualizations above, the variables don't have a linear relationship, so linear regression is not preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose predictor variables, played_hours and Age, because they are descriptions of \"kinds\" of players. They provide the most meaningful and various data to explore and predict from. Typically, they significantly contribute to determining total gametime. Gender was considered but it felt unreliable because there are \"prefer not to say\" values. These aren't helpful in narrowing down \"kinds\" of players. Similarily, each players' session times are random; it's not a unique behaviour to each player like age and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *To process the data, I will follow the general KNN regression model steps with noted adjustments:*\n",
    "1. Mutate \"experience\" to numerical levels(1 = beginner,... 5 = pro)\n",
    "2. Inspect and clean data\n",
    "3. Split dataset\n",
    "    - 75% training and 25% testing\n",
    "4. Tune training set\n",
    "    - Recipe: response variable = total_hours, predictor variables = Age + experience_levels\n",
    "        - Scale predictors\n",
    "5. Cross-validate training set\n",
    "        - 5 folds\n",
    "    - Make tibble with range of neighbors: 1 to 196\n",
    "        - Differ by 4; neighbors = 1, 5,... 196\n",
    "    - Create workflow, use *tune_grid* and *collect_metrics*\n",
    "6. Filter for optimal *k*\n",
    "7. Make new KNN model and workflow, assess on testing data, use *predict* and *bind_cols*, and collect metrics\n",
    "8. Compare RMSPE to cross-validation RMSE\n",
    "9. Use optimal *k*\n",
    "    - Fit into original dataset for final model\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression requires few assumptions compared to linear regression. It assumes that new observations are similar to its training data. Some setbacks is inaccurate predictions with observations outside the training data range. Moreover, a larger dataset means longer computation. Luckily, this dataset isn't too large, so computing should not be an issue. However, it can become a problem with additional data. It's also sensitive to noisy data and predicts by distance, so scaling is needed to ensure comparable variable scales."
