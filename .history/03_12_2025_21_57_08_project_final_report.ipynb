    "The dataset that we will use for our analysis comes from Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), which is part of the Department of Computer Science at UBC; the Minecraft server they run is aptly named PLAICraft. Their mission is to create ethical generative AI systems that will have a lasting positive impact on society. Through the collection of data from this Minecraft server, PLAI aims to create an advanced embodied AI which can interact with real people. All this is done by training an AI model on the thousands of hours of behavioural data of the players of this server. \n",
    "\\\n",
    "To ensure the data collected proves useful and is able to be easily analyzed, PLAICraft has certain rules that must be followed. The main rules are as follows:\n",
    "- If you are away from keyboard (AFK) for more than 5 minutes you will be removed from the server\n",
    "- All voice chat must be spoken in English\n",
    "- Please remember to play in a quiet environment without background noise\n",
    "- Please be sure to enter gameplay within 10 minutes of requesting a session\n",
    "As well, players must be generally respectful, they must not use any hacks or cheats while playing, and they must refrain from destroying other players' works. If players do not follow the above rules, their data is discarded and they are removed from the server. Finally, to ensure resources are not wasted, if players request a session and then do not show up (log in to the server) within 10 minutes, they endure a time penalty during which they cannot join the server. This time penalty increases as players continue to fail to show up for requested sessions, with a maximum penalty of 125 hours before players can next join the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Furthermore, PLAI encourages players to interact with each other via in-game voice chat, and they encourage players to invite their friends. Both of these are incentivized by additional playtime if players participate. Otherwise, players are allowed to play on the server for 3 minutes every hour they're away, up to a maximum of 30 minutes. As for the datasets we are concerned with for this analysis, their data was collected between May 1st, 2024 and September 1st, 2024. The sessions were tracked from the time the game was opened until it was closed by the players. There are two NA values in *players.csv*, for which we kept as other variables in those rows as may be valuable for exploratory visualizations and summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "As for the ethics involved, PLAI has received permission to run this study from the office of research ethics at UBC, and they require a consent form (or parental consent) for players to access the server. Emails and phone numbers are collected to send links to players in order to allow them to access the server, as well as if a player's data needs to be deleted for any reason. PLAI says they track gameplay, speech, and key presses in the PLAICraft Minecraft browser window; if for any reason a player wishes for part of their data to be excluded from collection, they are able to email support@plaicraft.ai for assistance. This is also the email to which players should write if they wish to report technical problems or abuses from other players. Now we will begin our analysis of the *players.csv* dataset. \n"

Players who play the same number of sessions do not necessarily play the same amount of hours. As well, the gaming experience is rather scattered across this chart, suggesting a weaker relationship between experience and hours/sessions played.

    "Before discussing our results, let's discuss our predictions and expectations. Based on our exploratory data analysis, in visualization #3, hours played and number of sessions increase together but don't depend on gaming experience. This was expected because players in the same experience level can have really different hours and sessions played. Based on visualization #2 and the data provided, we would expect that younger ages will play the game more and produce higher total hours played as they are generally on technology more. We can also anticipate that newer players (Amateurs) and seasoned, competitive players (Veterans) would log the most total hours played as seen in visualization #1. We can deduce that this trend is likely due to the release of dopamine from the anticipation of playing a new game. That is why new players will log more played hours. For veterans, they log more hours because for many of them, the game is almost like a job. Professionals and content creators play many hours to train their skills before tournaments and to stream to audiences in order to monetize their gaming skills. Knowing what age range and experience levels play the game the most will let us target those demographics in recruitment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating our model, the best *k* we found is 100 and its RMSPE value is 11.30 as shown in Step 6 of making our model. This suggests that our model predicts values with an error of 11.30 hours. Assessing this error with the context of our question, we can say that it is not the best error value. An error of 11 hours can be quite the deciding factor, considering that we are looking for types of players that could contribute large amounts of data. For instance, if a player actually had 30 hours of playtime, but was predicted to have 19 hours, we may reconsider recruiting those types of players when in reality, they did contribute a decent amount of hours. On the other hand, if a player had 10 hours of playtime, but predicted to have 21 hours, we may consider them for recruitment when they actually didn't contribute as much as we thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our model's data analysis, in visualization #5, we are comparing graphs of the actual testing data vs the predictions of the testing data the model made. As we can see, the predictions were fairly off. The \n",
    "After creating a tibble with randomized Age and experience_num values to test our model on, we may conclude that older players are most likely to play a smaller amount of hours of Plaicraft; therefore, contributing less data than younger players. This is shown visually in visualization #6. Therefore, we may consider recruiting younger players which is what we expected to find as stated before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of our model and thus, reasons for this RMSPE value arises from the dataset being real data. There is a high chance for variability amongst each player and there won't be many strong and consistent patterns or trends seen. In addition, outliers in our dataset may also affect our model. The highest amount of total hours played as seen in summary #2 was 223 hours, and the mean was 5 hours. If there were many strong outliers, even values in the 100s of hours, it may affect the predictions as they are based on the 100 closest data points, which is a large range of points we are basing it off of. Along the same lines, when *k* is 100, it is approximately 68% of our original dataset. This could cause some underfitting issues, making our model not influenced enough by the data. Moreover, data imbalance could also be a potential problem. As seen in summary #1, the distribution of experience levels is not even and pros only make up approximately 7% of the data while the other experiences make up 10 - 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "A suggestion to make our model better would be to try a smaller range of *k* values to avoid underfitting, collect more data to train our model with so there are more pros, an even distribution, and more data overall to base our predictions on as the original dataset may be considered on the smaller side. With this future changes, it would hopefully guide our model to becoming more accurate and lowering its RMSPE value."
