    " - Study runs under approval from UBC's office of research ethics\n",
    " - Players can halt their data being collected if they'd like\n",
    " - Hashed emails collected is where PlaiCraft access links were sent\n",
    " - Those 13 years old and under required guardian consent to collect their data\n",
    " - Data for each session was collected from when game browser opened to closed\n",
    " - Each server was monitored consistently\n",
    " - Sessions range from solo to multiplayer; but multiplayer was encouraged\n",

There is also no indication in the players.csv dataset about how long the data collection was for though. Furthermore, the order of the experience column is unclear. Usually the order from least to most experience is the one listed above. But, there is also no indication about it.

    "This visualization is the most helpful for our specific question. It's just a rough estimate of how many players are online at certain hours since I converted the time of day values to integers. So, it may not be the exact amount of players, but it should be relatively close. We can see that from 2 - 5am, a large amount of players are online. The number of players online is the lowest between 8am-2pm, and increases again from 3pm to the end of the day. I can connect these observations to visualization #2 in that I can assume that young adults are most likely in class or working. It makes sense why visualization #2 increases from 3pm to the end of the day all the way to 5am the next day because a lot of workers and students who are young adults get their free time late at night."

    "The method I would use to address my question of interest is non-linear regression. I would work on the sessions.csv dataset as it contains the variables and data that will help address the specific question. I can do the same mutating of the time values in the \"start_time\" column of the sessions.csv dataset shown earlier and group them in intervals of for example, 15 minutes; this will be the explanatory variable. Additionally, I would summarize the data to make a column based on how many players were starting at each of those intervals; this will be the response variable. I will then do the necessary training and validation of the data to create an optimal knn non-linear regression model. My question is more dependent on time of sessions and how many players are playing. Thus, the players.csv dataset does not contain any variables that will effectively aid my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model chosen is appropriate because I am looking to predict a numerical value, which compared to classification, would not be able to do. Also, with basing my classifer off of the explanatory variable, \"start_time\", and response variable, total players online, I would be able to efficiently input any time of the day and based on *k*, the classifier will output a prediction of total players online at that time. I can then decide myself if the number of players online is exceeding the number of licenses I currently have at hand for that time of day and decide what the best course of action is for the licenses.\n",

    "One setback is that it doesn't predict well when the new observation is outside the range of the data it was trained with. Moreover, as the dataset gets larger, the longer it takes to compute the output. Fortunately, this dataset is not too large so far, so it will not take long to compute an average outcome. However, it can become a problem for when more data is added to get a more accurate outcome. \n",
