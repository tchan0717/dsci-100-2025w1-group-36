    " - Study runs under approval from UBC's office of research ethics\n",
    " - Players can halt their data being collected if they'd like\n",
    " - Those 13 years old and under required guardian consent to collect their data\n",
    " - Data for each session was collected from when game browser opened to closed\n",
    " - Each server was monitored consistently\n",
    " - Sessions range from solo to multiplayer; but multiplayer was encouraged\n",

The number of players online is the lowest between 8am-2pm, and increases again from 3pm to the end of the day. I can connect these observations to visualization #2 in that I can assume that young adults are most likely in class or working.

    "To adress my question, I would use non-linear KNN regression. Briefly, I would work with both datasets as they both contain relevant variables I need; played_hours, Age, and I can create a new column based on hashedEmail for the total number of sessions played as each hashedEmail is unique to each player. I will do necessary training and validation of the data to create an optimal KNN non-linear regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression is appropriate because I want to predict a numerical value. KNN classification is for categorical predictions. Judging by visualization (), it doesn't seem like the variables have a linear relationship with each other, so linear regression is not preferred. Using the explanatory variable, \"start_time\", and response variable, total players online, the goal is to efficiently input any numerical time of day (ex. 18.5 = 6:30pm) and the classifier will output a prediction of total players online at that time. Then, I can decide if the number of players online is exceeding the number of licenses at hand and decide what the best course of action for license release is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, non-linear regression doesn't require much assumptions compared to linear regression where it assumes that the data is linear. A reason for its minimal assumptions is due to its nearest neighbours system. However, one setback is that its predictions can be inaccurate when predicting observations outside the range of its training data. Moreover, the larger the dataset, the longer it takes to compute the output. Fortunately, this dataset is not too large, so computing should not be an issue. However, it can become a problem for when more data is added to get a more accurate outcome. \n",
