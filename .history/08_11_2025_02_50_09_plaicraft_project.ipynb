    "Choosing an appropriate prediction model is important for accurate and strong performances. I would approach my question using non-linear KNN regression. Briefly, I would work with the players.csv dataset; it contains variables I need: played_hours, Age, and I would mutate the experience column, putting each category on a numerical level. The goal is to efficiently input any age and experience and receive a prediction for the total hours they may contribute. Then, we can decide whether or not to \"target\" those players.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression is appropriate because I want to predict a numerical value, played_hours. Contrastly, KNN classification is for categorical predictions. Judging by visualizations above, the variables don't have a linear relationship, so linear regression is not preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these explanatory variables because they are descriptions of \"kinds\" of players. I thought they provided the most meaningful and various data to explore and predict from. Typically, they contribute a lot to determining total gametime. Gender was considered but it felt unreliable because there are \"prefer not to say\" values which would not be helpful in narrowing down which gender to \"target\". Furthermore, the time variables don't correlate to \"kinds\" of players. Each players' session times start and end randomly, it's not a unique behaviour to each player like age and experience are.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *To process the data, I will follow the general knn regression model creation steps and make notes of specific changes where necessary:*\n",
    "1. Mutate experience to numerical levels(ex. 1 = beginner, 5 = pro)\n",
    "2. Inspect and clean data\n",
    "3. Split dataset\n",
    "    - 75% training and 25% testing.\n",
    "4. Tune training set\n",
    "    - recipe: response variable = total_hours, explanatory variables = Age + experience_levels\n",
    "        - Scale with *step_scale* and *step_center*\n",
    "5. Cross validation on training set\n",
    "        - 5 folds\n",
    "    - Make tibble with range of neighbors: 1 to 196\n",
    "        - Differ by 4; ex. neighbors = 1, 5,... 196\n",
    "    - Create workflow and use *tune_grid* and *collect_metrics*\n",
    "6. Filter and slice for optimal *k*\n",
    "7. Assess on testing data by making new knn model and workflow, then use *predict* and *bind_cols*, and collect metrics\n",
    "8. Compare RMSPE to cross-validation RMSE\n",
    "9. Use optimal *k* and fit into original dataset to create final model\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression requires few assumptions compared to linear regression. It assumes that new observations are similar to data it was trained with. Thus, one setback is inaccurate predictions when predicting observations outside the training data range. Moreover, a larger dataset means longer computation. Luckily, this dataset is not too large, so computing should not be an issue. However, it can become a problem when more data is added. It's also sensitive to noisy data and because it predicts by distance, scaling is needed to ensure one variable doesn't overtake."
