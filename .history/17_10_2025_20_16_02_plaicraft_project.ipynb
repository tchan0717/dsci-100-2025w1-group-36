The experience variable determines what \"level\" the players' gaming can be catergorized as Beginner, Amateur, Veteran, and Pro. Pro being the most experienced title, and Beginner being the least experienced. Moreover, the subscribe variable determines whether or not the player is subscribed to PLaiCraft, indicated with a TRUE or FALSE; TRUE for \"yes\" and FALSE for \"no\". The hashedemail variable represents the email address of the player, but in hashed form. The played_hours variable represents how many hours the player played PlaiCraft for (assuming over a few days) ranging from 0 hours to approximately 40 hours. The name, gender, and age variables represent the name, gender, and age of the player. The age ranges from approximately 9 to 47 years old.  One issue seen is that it is unclear over how many days this report has been collecting the data for. There is no indication of how long these hours_played were collected from. I also see another issue with the subscribe column. I assume this column is based on subscription of the game, as in who signed their email up for to play PlaiCraft. However, it is unclear whether this is the case or not or if the subscription is for another thing related to the game."
