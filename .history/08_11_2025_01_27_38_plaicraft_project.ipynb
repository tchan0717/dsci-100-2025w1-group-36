    "Choosing an appropriate prediction model is very important to ensure an accurate and strong performance. I would approach my question using non-linear KNN regression. Briefly, I would work with the players.csv dataset as it contains relevant variables I need; played_hours, Age, and I can mutate the experience column to make each category assigned to a numerical value from levels of 1 - 5. Then, I will do necessary training and validation of the data to create an optimal KNN non-linear regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN regression is appropriate because I want to predict a numerical value, played_hours. To compare, KNN classification is for categorical predictions, not numerical. Judging previous visualizations, it doesn't seem like the variables have a linear relationship with each other, so linear regression is not preferred. Using the explanatory and response variable chosen, the goal is to efficiently input any age and experience and the classifier will output a prediction of how many total hours they may contribute. Then, it can be decided to target those players or not for future session data collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these explanatory variables because they are descriptions of \"kinds\" of players and I thought they would provide the most meaningful and varying data to explore and predict from. Typically, they contribute a lot to determining how long one plays a game. Gender was considered too. I felt like gender was unreliable to predict from because there are some \"prefer not to say\" values which will not be helpful in narrowing down which gender to possibly \"target\". I didn't choose any of the time variables because I felt like it doesn't correlate well to \"kinds\" of players, and each players' session times start and end randomly, it is not a unique behaviour to each player like age and experience are.\n",

    "To conclude, fortunately, KNN regression doesn't require much assumptions compared to linear regression assuming linearity. Though, it does assume that new observations are similar to data it was trained with. Thus, one setback is that its predictions can be inaccurate when predicting observations outside the range of its training data. Moreover, the larger the dataset, the longer it takes to compute the output. Luckily, this dataset is not too large, so computing should not be an issue. However, it can become a problem for when more data is added. It's also sensitive to noisy data and because it predicts by distance, scaling is needed to ensure one variable doesn't overtake the other."
